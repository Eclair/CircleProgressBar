Installation
============

You can install this control in two ways:

1. Using CocoaPods:

```ruby
pod 'CircleProgressBar', '~> 0.32â€™
```

2. Manually:

  Download source from this repository and copy CircleProgressBarDemo/CircleProgressBar folder to your project.

  Don't forget to add **UIKit** and **QuartzCore** frameworks to your project.

How to use
==========

_NOTE: If you installed this control manually - please be sure that you've added UIKit and QuartzCore frameworks to your project._

_NOTE: If you're using rectangular view for CircleProgressBar control instead of square, ProgressBar will fit available area and will be drawn in center of it._

_NOTE: If you're using swift, be sure to add `import CircleProgressBar` to source file where you're using it._

You can simply add UIView in Interface Builder to your controller and change it's class to "CircleProgressBar" (overridden _initWithCoder_ method will be called) or create CircleProgressBar programmatically using _init_ or _initWithFrame_ methods.

Using Interface Builder you'll take advantage of Xcode 6 new live rendering feature to customize control according to your needs on the fly (will be explained below in "Customization" section).

To change progress, simply call "setProgress:animated:" method of CircleProgressBar instance:

**Objective-c**:
```objective-c
[_circleProgressBar setProgress:(CGFloat)progress animated:(BOOL)animated];
```
**Swift**:
```swift
circleProgressBar.setProgress(CGFloat, animated: Bool)
```

or "setProgress:animated:duration:" method to define custom animation time:


**Objective-c**:
```objective-c
[_circleProgressBar setProgress:(CGFloat)progress animated:(BOOL)animated duration:(CGFloat)duration];
```
**Swift**:
```swift
circleProgressBar.setProgress(CGFloat, animated: Bool, duration: CGFloat)
```

To check if there is ongoing animation use `isAnimating` property.
To stop an ongoing animation, you can use `stopAnimation` method. In this case it will set the progress to animation end value:

**Objective-c**:
```objective-c
[_circleProgressBar stopAnimation];
```
**Swift**:
```swift
circleProgressBar.stopAnimation()
```

Customization
=============

CircleProgressBar provides many customization properties:

```objective-c
// Progress Bar Customization
@property (nonatomic) CGFloat progressBarWidth;
@property (nonatomic) UIColor *progressBarProgressColor;
@property (nonatomic) UIColor *progressBarTrackColor;
@property (nonatomic) CGFloat startAngle;

// Hint View Customization (inside progress bar)
@property (nonatomic) BOOL hintHidden;
@property (nonatomic) CGFloat hintViewSpacing;
@property (nonatomic) UIColor *hintViewBackgroundColor;
@property (nonatomic) UIFont *hintTextFont;
@property (nonatomic) UIColor *hintTextColor;
```

Using these customization properties you can define Progress Bar's width, color of filled part, color of empty part, Progress Bar's start angle, Hint View's spacing (between progress bar and hint view), background color, hint text color and hint text font.

If you want to hide HintView you can simply set hintHidden property to NO.

To customize text inside HintView you can simply set TextGenerationBlock:

**Objective-c**:
```objective-c
[_circleProgressBar setHintTextGenerationBlock:(StringGenerationBlock)generationBlock];
```
**Swift**:
```swift
circleProgressBar.setHintTextGenerationBlock(generationBlock: StringGenerationBlock!)
```

For example this way:

**Objective-c**:
```objective-c
[_circleProgressBar setHintTextGenerationBlock:^NSString *(CGFloat progress) {
  return [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%.0f / 255", progress * 255];
}];
```
**Swift**:
```swift
circleProgressBar.setHintTextGenerationBlock { (progress) -> String? in
    return String.init(format: "%.0f / 255", arguments: [progress * 255])
}
```

If you want to use NSAttributedString you can set instead HintAttributedGenerationBlock:

**Objective-c**:
```objective-c
[_circleProgressBar setHintAttributedGenerationBlock:(AttributedStringGenerationBlock)generationBlock];
```
**Swift**:
```swift
circleProgressBar.setHintAttributedGenerationBlock(generationBlock: AttributedStringGenerationBlock!)
```

If you using Interface Builder, you can take an advantage of Xcode 6 live render with IBDesignable and IBInspectable features to customize control:
